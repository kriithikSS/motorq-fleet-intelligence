## 1. Introduction

By 2030, a connected car is expected to generate up to 25 GB of data every hour. Across a fleet of 100,000 vehicles, that is a continuous firehose of location, speed, battery, diagnostic and driver-behaviour signals that must be collected, cleaned, stored, analysed and turned into decisions within seconds.

This hackathon asks your team to build an enterprise-grade solution for that world. The case study uses Motorq, a US connected-vehicle intelligence company with engineering hubs in Chennai and Bangalore, as its industry reference. You will not copy Motorq's product; you will identify a real problem in the connected-vehicle space and engineer your own solution to it.

**What makes this challenge different:** it is open-ended in what you build, but strict in how well you build it. Scale, data engineering, system design, security, testing and DevOps are all expected at production quality.

## 2. Industry Context: Motorq

### 2.1 Company Snapshot

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Founded | 2016, San Francisco, USA |
| Stage | Series B; more than USD 50 million raised (Insight Partners, FM Capital, Story Ventures) |
| Hubs | San Francisco, Seattle, Chennai, Bangalore |
| Positioning | The enterprise platform for Connected Vehicle Intelligence |
| Scale | 25+ automotive brands, 500K+ connected vehicles daily, 250B+ vehicle signals processed per month |
| OEM partners | Volvo Cars, Subaru of America, Stellantis (via Mobilisights, 2026 OEM Partner of the Year) and others |

### 2.2 Which Industry Motorq Belongs To

Motorq sits where four industries meet. Understanding this helps you frame both the users and the technical constraints of your solution.

- **Automotive Technology:** works directly with vehicle manufacturers (OEMs) and their embedded telematics
- **Mobility SaaS / Enterprise Software:** sells subscriptions, portals and APIs to fleets, dealers and lenders
- **IoT and Big Data:** every vehicle is an edge device streaming high-volume, time-series data
- **Electric Vehicle Ecosystem:** supports mixed fleets of petrol, diesel, hybrid and fully electric vehicles

### 2.3 Business Model and Customers

Motorq's platform is device-free: instead of installing aftermarket OBD-II dongles, it pulls data directly from OEM clouds through commercial and technical partnerships. The data is normalised into one standard format and delivered as insights and workflows.

| Customer Segment | Typical Use of Vehicle Data |
|---|---|
| Commercial and rental fleets | Live location, utilisation, maintenance, fuel and idling cost, driver safety |
| Fleet management companies | Migrating customers from legacy hardware to OEM connectivity |
| Lenders | Vehicle recovery, collateral monitoring (Motorq reports a 68% reduction in recovery time) |
| Dealerships | Service retention, inventory tracking, remarketing |
| OEMs | Monetising and distributing their vehicle data to enterprises |

## 3. Industry Trends (2026 → 2030)

- **Data explosion:** McKinsey and S&P estimate up to ~25 GB/hour per connected car, and connected cars are projected to be ~95% of new vehicles sold by 2030. Most raw data must be filtered at the edge; only useful signal reaches the cloud.
- **Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV):** vehicles receive over-the-air updates and behave like rolling compute nodes, so data formats change more often.
- **Electrification:** mixed ICE/EV fleets need charging optimisation, battery state-of-health tracking and range prediction.
- **Cloud-agnostic pressure:** AWS IoT FleetWise closed to new customers in April 2026, a visible reminder of the risk of single-vendor lock-in.
- **Agentic AI:** AI copilots and agents are moving from dashboards to recommending and taking actions on fleet data.
- **Regulation:** UNECE R155/R156 require vehicle cybersecurity and software-update management for new vehicles in many markets; India's DPDP Rules were notified in November 2025; GDPR applies in Europe.

### 3.1 How Motorq Is Responding (From Public Sources)

- **Normalisation engine:** every OEM encodes events differently; Motorq continuously maps data from 25+ brands into one standard schema.
- **Streaming delivery:** customers consume data via portal, REST APIs and Kafka streams. In May 2026, Snowflake delivery went from about one hour to seconds (60x faster).
- **Motorq Fuse (April 2026):** an AI layer that monitors fleets, flags issues such as excessive idling, recommends actions and estimates the dollar impact of fixing them.
- **Engineering stack:** public job posts list Java, Go, Python and C#, distributed systems, AWS / Azure / GCP and agentic AI. Hiring rounds test DSA, OS, DBMS and REST API design.

## 4. The Problem at Scale

The core engineering problem is volume and velocity. The back-of-envelope estimate below uses conservative numbers for a single mid-sized platform.

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Connected vehicles | 100,000 | One mid-sized fleet customer base |
| Events per vehicle | 1 per second | Location, speed, battery, diagnostics |
| Ingest rate | ~100,000 events/sec | Bursts of 3x at shift start or network recovery |
| Event size | ~1 KB | JSON before compression |
| Raw volume | ~8.6 TB/day, ~3 PB/year | Before compression and down-sampling |

### 4.1 Why a Single SQL Database Fails Here

- **Write amplification:** every insert updates multiple B-tree indexes, so write throughput collapses as tables grow into billions of rows.
- **Lock and connection contention:** hundreds of thousands of concurrent writers exhaust connection pools and create lock waits.
- **Mixed workloads:** analytical scans over months of telemetry starve the transactional queries that dashboards and APIs depend on.
- **Vertical scaling limits:** a single primary node cannot scale writes horizontally without sharding.

Yet some data still needs strict ACID guarantees: fleet ownership, subscriptions, billing, access control and audit logs. A good solution uses the right store for each kind of data and explains the trade-offs.

## 5. Opportunity and Problem Spaces

Whoever turns this firehose into sub-second, trustworthy, actionable decisions owns the fleet-intelligence layer. The problem spaces below are starting points; you may choose one or define your own.

| Problem Space | Who It Helps | Example Question to Answer |
|---|---|---|
| Predictive maintenance | Fleet managers | Which vehicles are likely to break down in the next 7 days? |
| EV charging and battery health | EV fleets, OEMs | When and where should each vehicle charge at lowest cost? |
| Driver safety scoring | Fleets, insurers | Which drivers show risky patterns, and what should change? |
| Asset recovery | Lenders | Where is this vehicle now, and is it behaving abnormally? |
| Fuel, idling and utilisation cost | Fleet finance teams | Where are we losing money, and how much can we save? |
| Multi-OEM data normalisation | Platform teams | How do we onboard a new OEM format without downtime? |
| Privacy-safe data sharing | OEMs, regulators | How do we share insights without exposing personal data? |
| Fleet carbon reporting | Sustainability teams | What are our emissions per route, and how do we cut them? |

## 6. Your Challenge (Open-Ended)

Pick a real problem in the connected-vehicle space and build a working solution for it. There is no fixed specification: you choose the users, the features and the architecture. **Depth beats breadth.**

**Minimum bar every solution must meet:**

- Works on simulated data from at least 100,000 vehicles, generated by your own data simulator
- Processes events in real time and supports batch analytics over historical data
- Uses a combination of relational, NoSQL and (where useful) vector storage, each justified
- Exposes insights through secure APIs and a usable web interface
- Is containerised, tested and deployable on at least one cloud with no code changes needed for another

---

## 7. Technical Expectations

The table shows what reviewers look for in each area. Tools are examples only; choose any and justify your choices.

| Area | What a Strong Solution Shows | Example Tools (Pick Any) |
|---|---|---|
| IoT ingestion | Realistic data generator (bursty, out-of-order, duplicate events); idempotent, schema-validated, back-pressure-aware intake | MQTT (EMQX, Mosquitto), Avro / Protobuf |
| Messaging | Durable, partitioned streams with replay | Kafka (recommended) or RabbitMQ |
| Big data pipeline | Real-time detection within seconds plus batch analytics over billions of rows | Kafka Streams, Flink, Spark on Hadoop / HDFS or S3, Parquet, Iceberg |
| Persistence | Polyglot storage with a reason for each store | PostgreSQL / TimescaleDB, Cassandra / MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, Snowflake / ClickHouse |
| Full stack | Secure, paginated, rate-limited APIs and a clear UI | React; FastAPI (SQLModel), Spring Boot (Hibernate / JPA), ASP.NET Core, Go |
| ML and vector layer | A model that turns data into a decision, evaluated against a baseline | scikit-learn, PyTorch, pgvector, Qdrant |
| Agentic AI | An agent that answers or acts on fleet data, with guardrails and an audit trail | LangGraph, MCP tools, any LLM |
| Log analytics | Centralised logs, metrics and traces for a large event stream | Splunk or ELK, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus + Grafana |
| DevOps | Cloud-native microservices, IaC, CI/CD; cloud-agnostic deployment | Docker, Kubernetes / Helm, Terraform, GitHub Actions; AWS / GCP / Azure |

---

## 8. Data Engineering and Database Design

- **Normalisation:** design the relational core (e.g. Fleet, Vehicle, Driver, Trip, Alert, Subscription) in Third Normal Form, and document any deliberate denormalisation.
- **Polyglot design:** combine relational, NoSQL and vector stores; state which data lives where and why.
- **Partitioning:** partition telemetry by time and vehicle; choose shard keys that avoid hot spots.
- **Data generation:** generate 100,000+ vehicles with realistic trips, faults and noise; the simulator itself is part of your solution.
- **SQL optimisation:** show `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` before and after for your slowest queries: composite and partial indexes, materialised views, keyset pagination, removing ORM N+1 queries.

**Illustrative telemetry event (design your own):**

```json
{"vin":"1HGCM82633A004352","ts":"2026-09-25T10:15:02.120Z","lat":21.1702,"lon":72.8311,"speed_kmh":64.2,"soc_pct":41,"odo_km":18234.7,"dtc":["P0301"],"evt":"HARSH_BRAKE","seq":88412}
```

## 9. Algorithms and Data Structures

Use large-scale algorithms where your solution needs them. Examples:

| Area | Example Application |
|---|---|
| Graph | Nearest reachable charger under remaining range (Dijkstra / A\*); clusters of vehicles at unapproved depots (connected components) |
| Dynamic programming | Optimal EV charging schedule under time-of-use tariffs; segmenting noisy GPS into stops and trips |
| Regex and parsing | Validate VINs (17 characters, no I/O/Q, check digit); parse OBD-II fault codes such as P0301 from raw OEM payloads |
| Streaming algorithms | Sliding-window aggregates, de-duplication with Bloom filters, top-K with Count-Min Sketch, geohash indexing |

---

## 10. System Design Expectations

- **CAP theorem:** choose and justify consistency or availability for each kind of data. For example, billing may need CP (strong consistency) while raw telemetry can be AP (eventual consistency). Discuss PACELC latency trade-offs.
- **Principles tested:** partitioning and sharding, replication, idempotency, exactly-once vs at-least-once delivery, back-pressure, circuit breakers, CQRS and event sourcing, cache invalidation, horizontal scaling, graceful degradation.
- **Data lifecycle:** a hot / warm / cold storage strategy with a retention and cost estimate.
- **Architecture style:** microservices with clear boundaries, layered or hexagonal internals, and documented decisions (ADRs).

## 11. Non-Functional Requirements

| NFR | Target |
|---|---|
| Throughput | Sustain 100,000+ events/sec; survive a 3x burst for 5 minutes without data loss |
| Latency | Ingest to dashboard under 2 s; critical alert under 5 s; API p95 under 200 ms, p99 under 500 ms |
| Scalability | Stateless services scale horizontally; adding brokers or nodes needs no code change |
| Availability | No single point of failure; 99.9% target; recovers after a broker or pod is killed |
| Security | OAuth2 / OIDC + JWT, RBAC with tenant isolation, mTLS for devices, TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest, secrets in a vault, OWASP Top 10 and API Top 10 |
| Compliance | Audit logs for every data access and AI-agent action; masking of location data; retention and right-to-erasure flow (GDPR, DPDP) |

---

## 12. Testing Expectations

Testing is heavily weighted. All suites should run automatically in CI on every push.

| Test Type | Minimum Evidence |
|---|---|
| Unit | 80%+ coverage on core services and algorithms (pytest, JUnit 5 + Mockito) |
| Integration and contract | Real broker, databases and cache via Testcontainers; contract tests between services (Pact) |
| Acceptance | BDD scenarios for key user stories (Cucumber, behave) |
| Performance and load | k6, Locust or Gatling at 100,000 events/sec; throughput, p95/p99, consumer lag; one soak test |
| Security | SAST (Semgrep, SonarQube), DAST (OWASP ZAP), dependency and image scans (Trivy) |
| Compliance and chaos | Verify audit trail and erasure; kill a pod or broker and prove recovery |

- **Open source and AI tools:** allowed, but must be declared in your Solution Document.
- **Code freeze:** only commits before the deadline are reviewed; tag the final commit `v1.0-submission`.
- **Originality:** your problem framing, design and code must be your team's own work.
- **Affiliation:** Motorq is used only as an industry reference. This is an independent academic exercise with no affiliation to Motorq.
